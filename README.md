# 2012studio

2012 ROBLOX that allowed Hosting, Joining, and map development.
This was a Novetus addon, check out Novetus at http://bitl.itch.io/Novetus

# How to Install

DOWNLOAD: http://2012.hereelabs.cf/2012studio.zip (TEMPORARY until github actually decides to work)

First, download the 2012studio.zip file. Then, copy the files inside to its own folder
Inside Novetus' "Clients" folder.
Inside of the Novetus program, go to versions, and select 2012M. (Or whatever you named it)

# KNOWN BROKEN THINGS:

Toolbox [Never fixed]

In-Studio stamper tool [Never fixed]

Assets not loading [Never fixed]

# HOW TO FIX ASSETS

Use a program called "Notepad++" to replace all http://www.roblox.com/asset links to http://2012.hereelabs.cf/asset

# HOW TO HOST

Hosting was quite simple, if you know how to port forward. If you do not,
Search up your router name then port forwarding (EX: Xfinity Port Foward)
Port forward 53640 (this is the port ROBLOX uses)

# Hosting a LAN server?

Open up command prompt, and put in "ipconfig" find IPv4 Address : 192.168.xxx.xxx and tell it to your friend or family member.
Novetus is very easy to host on LAN. Select the client (in the VERSIONS area), select a map (in the MAPS area) go to the host area, and Click host. (DO NOT USE NO3D)
To join yourself, ALWAYS use 127.0.0.1 or your local ip. NEVER use your public ip to join yourself, as it will fail.

# Hosting a Online server?

Use http://ipchicken.com/ to find your external IP address.
Select the client, a map you want to host, and host it.
Share it with other players who want to join.
To join yourself, ALWAYS use 127.0.0.1 or your local ip. NEVER use your public ip to join yourself, as it will fail.

# Cannot port forward?

You can play solo by opening the studio exe file, going to tools, then clicking play solo. Maps may act differently when you do this, but it should work.
RAdmin and other similar services can also be used, but I cannot verify the credibility of them. Its up to you what you use to fix this problem.
