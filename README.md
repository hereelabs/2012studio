#HOW TO HOST

Hosting is quite simple, if you know how to port forward. If you do not,
Search up your router name then port forwarding (EX: Xfinity Port Foward)
Port forward 53640 (this is the port ROBLOX uses)

#Hosting a LAN server?

Use command prompt to find your local ip.
EX: 10.0.0.112
People on the internet cannot connect to it, only people in your local network.

#Hosting a Online server?

Use http://ipchicken.com/ to find your external IP address.
Share it with other players who want to join.
Enjoy!

#Cannot port forward?

You can still play solo without port forwarding by starting a server and joining yourself with IP 127.0.0.1
RAdmin and other similar services can also be used, but I cannot verify the credibility of them. Its up to you what you use to fix this problem.
